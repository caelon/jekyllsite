One cost-cutting measure some startups seek is using offshore development for all of some of its code. While the apparant cost savings can be large, this is a step that has to be taken with extreme care.

I've managed many offshore development teams in my various roles. I've worked with teams from all over the world, including India, Phillippines, Ukraine, and Brazil. I've also worked with remote teams within the U.S., whether it was a dev group in a single city or developers spread through the U.S. and Canada. I've worked with some who were excellent and others that did not produce as expected.

The key element to achieving success with an offshore development team, regardless of location, are strict requirements. 

When working on startup code, rapid iteration is a necessity. The members of the team in charge of the product vision have to be working closely with those creating the prototype or MVP. That type of fluid, rapid, changes are not something I've seen be successful with offshore groups.
